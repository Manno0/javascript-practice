 * - if statements: Executes a block of code only if a specified condition evaluates to true.
 * - if...else statements: Provides an alternative block of code to execute if the initial condition evaluates to false.
 * - Comparison operators: Evaluates relationships between values, such as greater than or equal to (>=), to drive decision-making.
